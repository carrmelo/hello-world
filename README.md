# hello-world
this is how everything started.
I was so tired of my everyday job and it was so dificult to find something new in my area that I decided to get back to zero, again, and go for something that could actually give me options. To my surprise, I found a new path that challenged me to think outside of my confort zone, and that I'm actually enjoying. Coding may be a good new answer I've been looking to get the places I still dream about. So I just need to remember that if I get lost in the woods is because I want to.
